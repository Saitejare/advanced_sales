Breast Cancer Detection

This project is focused on building and evaluating machine learning models for breast cancer detection using data analysis and predictive modeling techniques. The main workflow is implemented in the Jupyter notebook breast_cancer_detection.ipynb.

Project Structure

breast_cancer_detection.ipynb: Main notebook containing data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and results.

Features
Data loading and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Model training (for example, logistic regression, decision trees, etc.)
Model evaluation and comparison
Visualization of results

Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd brest_canser
2. Install dependencies
   It is recommended to use a virtual environment (for example, venv or conda).
   Install required Python packages (see below).

3. Run the notebook
   Open breast_cancer_detection.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
   Execute the cells step by step.

Requirements

Python 3.7 or higher
Jupyter Notebook
Common data science libraries (for example, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, seaborn)

You can install the main dependencies with:
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn jupyter

Usage

Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess, train models, and evaluate results.
Modify or extend the notebook to experiment with different models or datasets.
